# psahackathon Application 

## Description 
Application was developed during psahackathon CodeSprint 2021.
https://www.psacodesprint.com/

Application focuses on tackling issue involving inefficencies in allocation of hauliers due to a lack of visbility over which loading bays in one of 5 warehouses is empty at any point in time. 

Application is divided into 3 main parts, a driver application, a haulier application and finally a warehouse application, each of these apps serving a particular purpose, similar to that of a delivery application where there is a user, the deliverman and the restaurant(merchant).

### Driver Application 
- Through the driver application, the driver is able to view their current task along with any up and coming tasks allocated to them by the haulier company. 
- This enables them to do away with the need of figuring out their schedule and wasting time waiting around until the loading bay is empty. 

### Haulier Application 
- The haulier is able to monitor the current status of the drivers through this application and allocate containers in real-time to the drivers. 

### Warehouse Application 
- The warehouse application is able to monitor all of the loading bays in every single warehouse, and free or reserve particular loading bays. 

## To run the application 
- Simply ```git pull```
- Followed by ```flutter run``` after opening the program in android emulator
